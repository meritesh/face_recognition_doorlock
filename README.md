 To develop and design an automated door using Raspberry Pi.
 Designed code for detecting and capturing frames with faces using ’eye’ and ’frontalface’ harcascade classifiers. 
 Storing the images in newly created dataset as a numpy array and training face recognizer for those set of images.
 Embeded system code for Raspberry Pi, which compares images against recognizer and open Solenoid door lock usingrelay module if matched.
